              The idea to open a video game store came to the owner back in 2001. It was only in 2004 that the first counter appeared where you could buy comics, buy a couple of games for consoles and various accessories. In 2009, a full-fledged store was opened, which contained the newest models of consoles and games. Parents could leave their children to play here, and they themselves went to spend their personal time. 2022 a website appears, with the help of which it has become much easier to buy games
